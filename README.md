# Questionnaire-Tool

Developed an application which would allow creating a questionnaire made up of several questions. This application included the questions of following types - Yes/No, Multiple choices, Multiple Answer, and Likert.

However, it is designed in such a way that it could include any number of new question types. Scalability - being the most important feature - has been achieved because of the incorporation of Union design pattern in this application. Apart from that, the application also applied the double dispatch mechanism due to which the code is less resilient to future changes.
